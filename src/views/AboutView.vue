      <h2>Manifesto</h2>
      Crossroads LARP is a project designed to facilitate collaborative storytelling above all else. 
      This is our guiding principle when shaping mechanics.  For example, a skill that encourages characters to interact with each other is always more interesting than one used is isolation.
      This is also key in designing the setting. Lore must be written with tensions between NPC factions in mind, so that player characters can find niches for agency between them.
      <br/>
      Given that some NPC factions are heritage based, in-character racism between fantasy races is a likely conflict that players will experience. As designers, it is our duty to ensure these tensions do not encourage a hostile environment out of character.

      Rape is not a permitted topic in this LARP.
